                memories to life in a powerfully vivid way. And that’s just the beginning. Take a

                The original iPhone introduced the world to Multi-Touch, forever changing the way
                people experience technology. With 3D Touch, you can do things that were never
                possible before. It senses how deeply you press the display, letting you do all
                kinds of essential things more quickly and simply. And it gives you real-time
                feedback in the form of subtle taps from the all-new Taptic Engine.

                The 12-megapixel iSight camera captures sharp, detailed photos. It takes brilliant
                4K video, up to four times the resolution of 1080p HD video. iPhone 6s also takes
                selfies worthy of a self-portrait with the new 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera. And
                it introduces Live Photos, a new way to relive your favorite memories. It captures
                the moments just before and after your picture and sets it in motion with just the
                press of a finger.

                The combination of bright red and blue colors makes a 
                new color like a slightly yellowish brown, formed with 
                boxes which are basically light and dark squares making motifs 
                that are in harmony with natural stones. This latest product provides a 
                new experience for every consumer who wants to beautify bedrooms, swimming 
                pools and artificial gardens in front of the home page.

                Innovation isn’t always obvious to the eye, but look a little closer at iPhone 6s
                and you’ll find it’s been fundamentally improved. The enclosure is made from a new
                alloy of 7000 Series aluminum — the same grade used in the aerospace industry. The
                cover glass is the strongest, most durable glass used in any smartphone. And a new
                rose gold finish joins space gray, silver, and gold.
